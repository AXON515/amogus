# amogus - Apple Music Hi-Res Artwork Fetcher

`this is my first real python tool so sorry if its bad`



amogus is a Python script that if provided an Apple Music Link downloads the Highest Available Resolution cover Artwork as a .png, .jpg and .webp file. Why all three? Since they tend to differ vastly in color and/or color room. 


## How to use:

Download `amogus.py` and the `requirements.txt`, put them in a folder and cd into it. Then you do

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Just start the script by typing the following in the console:
```python
python amogus.py
```
You will then encounter the prompt that asks you for an apple music album URL.

The Pictures get saved to a Directory named "CoverArtworks" in the Pictures Folder located in C:\Users\<Username>\Pictures or as a bookmark in Windows explorer.

## To-Do:
- Choosing Folder to Download to
- Print Resolution While Downloading
- Print Size of Downloaded Files

im open for any ideas since this is basically the thing i tried to learn python for and so far its really fun. I legit sat like 2 days on this straight up cuz is fucking knew nothing about python.

## Why did i do this:
I realized that artworks from apple sometimes differ in color so i wrote this script to just batch save them all and save me the hassle of copying the image url everytime and fiddeling around with it.
